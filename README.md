## 🔄 Workflow

1️⃣ **User Input**: The user enters a blog topic via the Streamlit UI.  
2️⃣ **Trigger API Request**: The request is sent to **Amazon API Gateway**.  
3️⃣ **Processing in AWS Lambda**: API Gateway triggers an **AWS Lambda function**, which forwards the request to **Amazon Bedrock**.  
4️⃣ **Content Generation**: **Mistral 7B**, embedded in Bedrock, generates the blog content.  
5️⃣ **Storage in Amazon S3**: The generated blog is stored in **Amazon S3**.  
6️⃣ **Fetching the Blog**: The user retrieves the blog via API Gateway.  
7️⃣ **Display on UI**: The fetched blog is displayed on the **Streamlit app**.
